# Nokia Internship Projects

These are the projects that I worked on during my internship at Nokia.

They are mostly about SR Linux configurations and automation with Python.

To use these projects, you need an SR Linux device. You can virtually create and use one with Docker or ContainerLab. More details at their documentation.
